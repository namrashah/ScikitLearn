MLP classifier is used in all the practicals

Neural Networks with the minimum number of hidden layers and minimum number of nodes is used to obtain close to 100% accuracy on the validation set.

One can change the activation function, number of hidden layers and nodes, etc to play around and somehow come up with a better solution.
